Vossian antonomasia is a stylistic device which attributes a certain property to a person by 
naming another (more well-known, more popular) person as a reference point. For instance, when Jim Koch 
is described as “the Steve Jobs of Beer”, certain qualities of Steve Jobs, be it entrepreneurship or 
persuasiveness, are assigned to Jim Koch, co-founder and chairman of the Boston Beer Company. VAs consist 
of three parts: a source (in our example “Steve Jobs”) serves as paragon to elevate the target (“Jim Koch”) 
by applying a modifier (“of Beer”) that provides the corresponding context. VA is named after Gerardus Vossius (1577– 1649), 
the Dutch classical scholar and author of rhetorical textbooks, who first distinguished and described VA as a separate phenomenon.

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
